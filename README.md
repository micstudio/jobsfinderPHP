# jobsfinderPHP

The website is online:

https://jobsfinder.a2hosted.com/



Project created to show php v.7.4 and mysql skills.

The application is an example page of an advertising portal for the IT industry.

The website enables users to register in two roles with different privileges.

The "Employee" profile allows you to search for job offers and view details.

The "Employer" profile allows you to add new offers to the website.

The connection to the database enables the execution of all CRUD operations.

In the further part of the project development, I intend to extend the functionality and refactor the code.

To implement the project on a local computer, install XAMPP (Apache & MySql), configure and import the jobs.sql file into the database.
